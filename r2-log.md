## Log

### R2D1
Today I feel completed defeated and had a moment of break down. I took an online interview for a technical prep course and I couldn't even get past the first challenge. Pretty sure I didn't get in. I have found myself in a low place of questioning my skills and knowledge, feeling like a complete imposter who has wasted a year and now, as I seek new opportunities that will actually benefit my my growth, I find that I am behind and so this is my being proactive in my learning, picking up the pieces and making strides with what I have. I CAN DO THIS..... and I need an accountability partner.

### R2D2
Worked on some flexbox using Flexbox Zombies. So far I am enjoying it alot and looking forward to practicing daily.
I also looked at potential resume and cover letter resources to better increase my chances at landing a remote job in the near future.
Twitter support if very motivating, but I DO need an accountability partner.

###R2D3
Tired and had a long day. Took a nap and made sure to get some time in to code.
Just finished Flexbox Zombies Chapter 4. Mind blown. https://flexboxzombies.com

###R2D4
I managed to do some more practice with #CodeZombies but I spent a lot of time on personal professional development üòÅ
My biggest struggle, Consistency. If I make it to 30 days nonstop I should be in the habit of it.

###R2D5 Attended blockchain meetup for Women. Thx @Gyals_Network Eager to learn more!

###R2D6 Just finished #FlexboxZombies Ch 5: Where the Wild Things Grow. Amazing!
