### R1D1 
Today I feel completed defeated and had a moment of break down. I took an online interview for a technical prep course and I couldn't even get past the first challenge. Pretty sure I didn't get in. I have found myself in a low place of questioning my skills and knowledge, feeling like a complete imposter who has wasted a year and now, as I seek new opportunities that will actually benefit my my growth, I find that I am behind and so this is my being proactive in my learning, picking up the pieces and making strides with what I have. I CAN DO THIS..... and I need an accountability partner.
